# Backpressure

This repo demonstrates how backpressure happens through the use of goroutines and channels in Go, along with some common methods of fixing it.

## Quickstart
Ensure you have `go 1.24` or greater, stdlib used so no extra dependecies.

Run the files as
`go run backpressure.go` for the backpressure situation example.

For each of the fixes, the dir name shows which fix they refer to, with the file being named as `main.go`, which can be run as

`go run feedback/main.go`
